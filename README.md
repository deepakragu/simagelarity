# S(Image)larity

## Overview
API that outputs similarity of two images (percentage)

## Usage
First, download this project or pull the code locally using `git clone https://github.com/deepakragu/simagelarity.git`
Next, fill out `input.txt` with your API Credentials along with the URLs/filenames of the two images you would like to compare. Edit `input.txt` by adding your API key (as this is a demo, any string consisting of a character followed by 3 numeric values followed by 3 characters (ex: 6bTh072) will be considered as valid authentication) followed by entering the URLs or filenames of the two images you would like to compare    
Finally, open a terminal window or bash script and run `python3 script.py` in the simagelarity module/folder, and follow any other instructions displayed
