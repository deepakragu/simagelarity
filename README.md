# S(Image)larity

## Overview
API that outputs similarity of two images (percentage)

## Usage
Edit input.txt by adding your API key (as this is a demo, any string consisting of a character followed by 3 numeric values followed by 3 characters (ex: 6bTh072) will be considered as valid authentication) followed by entering the URLs or filenames of the two images you would like to compare
