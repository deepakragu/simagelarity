# S(Image)larity

## Overview
API that outputs similarity of two images (percentage)

## Usage
First, download this project or pull the code locally using `git clone https://github.com/deepakragu/simagelarity.git`. Make sure to have validator collection and OpenCV installed (if not, run the `pip install validator-collection`, `pip3 install opencv-python`, and `pip install opencv-contrib-python commands` in your terminal)

If you would like to run this API locally (i.e. have textual output on your terminal, fill out `input.txt` with your API Credentials along with the URLs/filenames of the two images you would like to compare. Edit `input.txt` by adding your API key (as this is a demo, any string consisting of a character followed by 3 numeric values followed by 3 characters (ex: 6bTh072) will be considered as valid authentication) followed by entering the URLs or filenames of the two images you would like to compare. If you are using local images, add these images in the `images/user_images` subdirectory.

Finally, open a terminal window or bash script and run make in the simagelarity module/folder, and follow any other instructions displayed (instructions may be repeated)
